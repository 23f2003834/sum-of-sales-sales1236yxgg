# Sales Summary Single-Page Application

This HTML document implements a simple client-side application that:
- Loads Bootstrap 5.3.3 CSS from CDN with a fallback style.
- Parses CSV data from an embedded string (representing an attachment).
- Calculates the sum of the `sales` column.
- Sets the document title to include a specific seed.
- Displays the total sales inside the element with ID `#total-sales`.

**Implementation Details:**
- All logic is contained within a `<script>` tag.
- Verifies `document.title` and load of Bootstrap stylesheet.
- Ensures the total sales displayed matches the calculated sum within a margin of error.
- Uses Bootstrap for styling; falls back to basic styles if Bootstrap fails.

**Usage:**
Open the `index.html` file directly in a web browser.
